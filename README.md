# Short description of the program
#### This program is a ping pong game. On the screen you can see a blue bat, a red bat, and the ball. You can move the bats upwards or downwards by:
  * up, down, right & left

  * W, A, S & D

#### And then the program calculates the score. If the ball hits the right or left edges of the wall, that's a point. When one player gathers the 10th point, the score becomes level again (0 - 0) to start a new round
